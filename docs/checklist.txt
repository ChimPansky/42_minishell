- $ expansion in heredoc wasnt supported
- no space in export was allowed
- didnt like that the pipes were running with |||||| and no error message


segfault with the exit (exit | exit 42)


mkdir -p a/b/c/d
cd a/b/c/d/
rm -rf ../../../../
pwd -> Memory leak (but no segfault)

126, 127 err codes
ajsdfkljasdfj -> command not found
echo $? -> Invalid read/write

empty input
check allowe var names
empty delimiter heredoc


- Memory leaks
	- Leaks when you have a permission denied (ex: /bin/)
	- In case of a correct / incorrect command
	- Also some problems with allocations, sometimes reading too much and getting invalid values that
	can lead to some weird problems

Echo
	- when you encounter a false option, you will continue to parse and split, even if bash
	would stop at this point
		example: echo -s -nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn -n -n yo

- Expander
	- Doubles quotes are not working, in the case of echo "$USER", it should expand but it's actually not

Exit
	- If no argument are provided, it should take the previous exit code

Return status
	- When pressing enter, the exit status is not changed and still use the previous one
	TLDR: fix ur waitpid
	- Syntax error, the value should be 2 and not 127 like an invalid command

export
	- If an export start with a value which is not a number, it should work
	(so if you do export _1test=yo it should work)

Redirections
	- No output file -> segfault
Pipes
	- Pipe without argument -> segfault


Parsing
	- not correctly parsed when builtins + something else
		example: pwd >> hello

Backrooms escape code:
	minishell: cat << ''
	> ''
	>
	> ""
	> "''"
	>
